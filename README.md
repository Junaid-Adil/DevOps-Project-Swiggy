                                    **Swiggy Clone App Deployment – A Real-Time DevOps Project**
**🚀 Project Overview**
In this project, I implemented a complete CI/CD pipeline for deploying a Swiggy-like food delivery application using DevOps best practices. The pipeline ensures automation, security, and scalability from code commit to production deployment.

**🛠️ Tools & Services Used**
✅ Terraform – Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for provisioning cloud resources
✅ GitHub – Version control to manage source code
✅ Jenkins – CI/CD pipeline automation for continuous integration and deployment
✅ SonarQube – Code quality and security scanning
✅ OWASP Dependency Check – Security vulnerability scanning
✅ Trivy – Container vulnerability scanning
✅ Docker & DockerHub – Containerization and image storage

**🔹 Key Implementations & Workflow**
1️⃣ Infrastructure Provisioning with Terraform

Used Terraform to automate the creation of cloud infrastructure, including servers, networking, and storage.
2️⃣ Version Control & CI/CD Pipeline

Managed source code using GitHub.
Configured Jenkins to trigger builds automatically on code commits.
3️⃣ Code Quality & Security Analysis

Integrated SonarQube to analyze code for bugs, code smells, and vulnerabilities.
Implemented OWASP Dependency Check to detect security issues in dependencies.
4️⃣ Containerization & Security Scanning

Built Docker images for application deployment.
Scanned Docker images for vulnerabilities using Trivy.
5️⃣ Deployment & Scaling

Pushed Docker images to DockerHub for version control.
Deployed the application in a containerized environment with Docker.
Ensured scalability and high availability.
**🌟 Impact & Outcome**
✔️ Fully automated software deployment workflow
✔️ Improved security by scanning for vulnerabilities at multiple levels
✔️ Faster deployments with containerized infrastructure
✔️ Scalable & reproducible deployment process
